# TOPIC -> Italics and Bold
To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.
e.g : Hi My _Name_ is _Rohan_

Similarly, to bold phrases in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across
e.g : Hi My _Name_ is **Rohan**

Place the asterisks **_on the outside_** to make both bold and italic.
e.g: Hi My name is **_Rohan_**

# TOPIC -> Headers
To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of  
the header you want. 
For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).
e.g.:
# Header one
## Header two
### Header three
#### Header four
##### Header five
###### Header six

# TOPIC -> Links
There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an 
inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in 
parentheses ( ( ) ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link 
text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

e.g.: 
[Google](www.google.com)  
[**Go to GitHub**](www.github.com)
